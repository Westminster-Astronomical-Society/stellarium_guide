This is a basic reference guide for Stellarium, an open-source planetarium software. It is intended to be a quick reference for users who are new to the software, as well as a reference for scripting in Stellarium. There is a comprehensive users guide available at [https://stellarium.org/](https://stellarium.org/), but this guide is intended to be a more concise reference for users who are not familiar with the software.

The website has sample scripts and a scripting API reference, but there is no published guide for scripting in Stellarium. And so, this guide will give an overview of the scripting API and provide some basic examples of it's use.
