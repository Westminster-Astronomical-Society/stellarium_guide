# Navigating the Night Sky

When you first launch Stellarium, the default settings will show you the sky as it appears from your location at the current time and date. You can use the arrow keys or left-click and drag to pan around the sky. Use `Ctrl+up` and `Ctrl+down` or  `PgUp`, `PgDn` to zoom in and out. You can also use mouse scroll wheel or laptop touchpad. `Shift+N, S, E, W, Z` will move to the North, South, East, West, or Zenith. `Ctrl+H` will bring you back to the default view. The `F1` key will open a help dialog with all of the keyboard shortcuts. They can also be found in [Appendix A.](appendix-A.md) of this document.


## Selecting Objects

You can select objects in the sky by clicking on them. The selected object will be highlighted and information about it will be displayed in the top left corner of the screen. Pressing the space bar will center the selected object in the view. Pressing the `/` key will zoom in on the selected object and the `\` key will zoom back out.

You can also search for objects by pressing `F3` and typing the name of the object you are looking for. Stellarium will show you a list of possible matches. Select the object you want and press Enter.

There is a tab to query SIMBAD for more information about a selected object. More information about SIMBAD can be found at the [CDS Portal](http://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/simbad/).

## Coordinate Grids

There are two buttons on the bottom toolbar to display the equatorial and horizontal coordinate grids. The `e` and `z` keys will toggle display of the equatorial and horizontal grids respectively. The equatorial grid is for the equator of date. The markings tab of the sky options dialog allows you to display and customize the appearance of many more. The Sky options are accessed by pressing `F4` or the third button from the top on the left toolbar. See [Appendix A.](appendix-A.md) for keyboard shortcuts for displaying the various sky markers.
